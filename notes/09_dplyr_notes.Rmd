# Introduction 

## Preparation

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,error=TRUE) 
library(dplyr); library(nycflights13)
data(flights)
```

## Exploring airline flight data with dplyr. 

## Filter

Select all flights on January 1st with 
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

Filter the flights data set to only select flights in January or February.
```{r}
filter(flights, month == _ | month == _)
```

## Select
Select the variables month, day and year from the flights data set. 

```{r}
select(flights, _____, ___, ____)
```

You can use a colon (:) to select all columns physically located between two variables. 
```{r}
select(flights, ____:____)
```

To exclude specific columns you use the minus sign (-)
```{r}
select(flights, -___)
```

This also works to exclude all columns EXCEPT the ones between two variables. 
```{r}
select(flights, -(____:___))
```


## Mutate

Create two variables: gain (as arrival delay minus departure delay) and speed (as distance divided by time, converted to hours). 
```{r}
a <- mutate(_____, ____ = arr_delay - dep_delay, 
                  _____ = distance / air_time * 60)

select(a, gain, distance, air_time, speed)
```

Or, 
```{r}
mutate(flights, ____ = arr_delay - dep_delay, 
                gain_per_hour = _____ / (air_time / 60 ))
```  


## Summarize
Calculate the average departure delay on the entire flights data set. 
```{r}
summarise(_______, delay = mean(______, _______))
```



# Grouped Operations
Create a new data set that is grouped by month. 

```{r}
by_month <- group_by(flights, ______)
```

Orders first by grouping variables, then by the sorting variable. 
```{r}
how_long <- arrange(by_month, _______)
select(how_long, month, distance)
```


The average distance flown per month. 
```{r}
summarise(______, avg_airtime = mean(distance, na.rm=TRUE))
```

Total number of flights per month. 
```{r}
summarize(by_month, count=_______)
``` 

# Chaining Operations

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(___, ___, ___) %>%
  ______(arr_delay, dep_delay) %>%
  ________(
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ______(arr > 30 | dep > 30)
```
