# Introduction


## Preparation
* Change the path below to import the `NCbirths` data set. 
* load the `dplyr` library in this same code chunk

```{r}
NCbirths <- read.csv("../data/NCbirths.csv", header=TRUE)
```

# Missing Data

## Problems


## Identifying missing values 


----

# Summarizing data


## Frequency Tables for categorical data
Create a frequency table for whether or not the baby was born underweight. 

```{r}
 
```

Do it again but show if there are any missing. 

```{r}
 
```

## Summary statistics for numerical data

Summary statistics for the number of visits. 

```{r}

```

-----

# Recoding data



**Example 1: Too low birthweight**

Set all records where `weight=1` to missing. 

```{r}
 
```

Confirm it worked by creating a boxplot of `weight`. 
```{r}

```

-----

# Creating new variables


#### **Example: basic arithmetic on existing variables**


Create a new variable `wtgain_mom` the weight gained by the mother, that is not due to the baby by subtracting `weight` from `gained`.
```{r}
 
```

Confirm this variable was created correctly

```{r}

```



## Dichtomizing data 

Make a new variable `underage` on the `NCbirths` data set. If `mage` is under 18, then the value of this new variable is `underage`, else it is labeled as `adult`. 

```{r}

```

Confirm it worked.

```{r}
 
```


# Chaining using the pipe %>%

```{r}

```
