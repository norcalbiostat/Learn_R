# Introduction

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(forcats)
email <- read.table("../data/email.txt", header=TRUE, sep="\t")
```



# What is a factor?

First we should confirm that R sees `number` as a factor. 
```{r}

```

We can use the `levels()` function to get to know factor variables. 

```{r}

```

How many records are in each level?

----

# Convert a number to Factor

**Example: Is the email flagged as spam?**

Use the function `factor()` to convert the numeric variable `spam` to a factor, applying `lables` to convert 0 to "no" and 1 to "yes". 

```{r}

```

**Always confirm your recode** 

```{r}

```

# Factor ordering
